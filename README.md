# Heart Health Analysis App

The **Heart Health Analysis** app is a mobile application designed for real-time, continuous heart rate monitoring. It uses **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** for contactless heart rate detection. The app is built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **Firebase** for data storage.

## Features
- **Contactless Heart Rate Detection:** Utilizes rPPG technology to measure heart rate using a mobile camera.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous heart rate tracking and live feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind for ease of use.
- **Cloud Database Integration:** Stores data securely in Firebase for access across multiple devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter:** Frontend framework for building the mobile interface.
- **Firebase:** Cloud database for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **rPPG (Remote Photoplethysmography):** Signal processing method for detecting heart rate through a mobile camera without physical contact.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest version) installed on your machine.
- A Firebase account set up and configured.

### Frontend Setup (Flutter)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muskan2911/heart-health-analysis.git
    cd heart-health-analysis/frontend
    ```

2. Get the Flutter dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Connect the app to Firebase:
   - Configure Firebase in your Flutter project using `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS.

4. Run the Flutter app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the app and allow access to the camera.
2. Position the camera towards your face for the rPPG-based heart rate detection.
3. View your heart rate in real-time on the app's dashboard.
4. The data is saved to Firebase and can be accessed later.

## Signal Processing Overview

The heart rate detection algorithm uses **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)**, which extracts the heart rate by analyzing subtle changes in skin color from the video feed captured by the phoneâ€™s camera. The app leverages signal processing techniques to filter noise and isolate the heart rate signal from the data.

### Key signal processing techniques used:
- **Bandpass filtering** to remove noise.
- **Peak detection** to determine the heart rate from periodic changes in the signal.
